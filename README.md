# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of custom data structures in a Java application. These classes provide insight into linked list, stack, and queue operations, which are foundational in computer science.

The banking application, Bank.java, serves as a practical example that interacts with the Person class, modeling a bank system where individuals perform transactions and data structures manage internal operations.

# Classes
Bank.java
The Bank class represents a simple banking application where Person objects are managed using various data structures like stacks and queues.

MyLinkedList.java
This class implements a custom linked list, managing elements through Node objects. It provides typical operations such as adding, removing, and traversing nodes.

MyQueue.java
This class demonstrates a queue data structure using a linked list as the underlying structure. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

MyStack.java
This class implements a stack data structure, adhering to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It uses a linked list as its base.

myStackAndQueue.java
This class is a utility that demonstrates how both stacks and queues are used in a practical example.

Node.java
The Node class represents individual elements in the linked list, storing a reference to the next node and holding data.

Person.java
This class models a person with attributes such as name, age, and other relevant information for the bank simulation.
